# Welcome to my Statistics Calculator!

## To Do's
- make the program able to accept csv's (and maybe other file types in the future)
- restructure the program to a CLI
- make a website for the stat calculator
- use cmake to launch

## Goals
- Create a simple calculator that can calculate almost anything you throw at it from your statistics class
- Provide an easy to follow interface 
- Allow users to have all in one program that does everything instead of having them search online for different types of statistic calculators

## Functionality 

### Contains Its own Formula Sheet!

### Basics: takes the dataset and displays:
- mean, median, mode, range
- Sample/Population standard deviation & variance
- Min and Max
- Percentiles
- Interquartile range
- Outliers

### Hypothesis Testing
- calculate z-score and t-score
- one/two sample **t** and **z** tests
  - proportions, pair, difference 
- Chi-square test

### Confidence intervals 
- Sampling Distribution
- z/t confidence intervals
  - proportion, sample
  - multple z-critical values
  
### Correlation Coefficient
- slope, y-intercept
- line of best fit 
- least squares regression line

## How-To-Use
- clone this repository
- cd into it from terminal
- run ```make``` then ```make run``` or ```./main```
